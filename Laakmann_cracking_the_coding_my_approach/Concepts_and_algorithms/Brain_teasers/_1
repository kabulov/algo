enumerate bottles from 0 to 19
for bottle 0<=i<=19:
0: dont put one the scale
1 through 9: take i pills from bottle
10 through 18: take 1000 * (i - 9) pills from bottle
19: take 10^6 pills from bottle

if heavy bottle has index:
0: the weight will be 1045045
1 through 9: rational number, [int_part],[real_part], real part is i
10 through 18: the sum will be 45(i-9)45
19: the sum will be 1145045
