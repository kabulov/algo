SOLUTION

colors of cells on opposite corners of the chess board have same color (depends on the parity of (i+j))
so there are 30 cells of one color left, and 32 of other left, 
but as each domino covers exactly one cell of each color,
then the amount of covered cells of each color must be same
but the amount of cells left is not equal , hence
we cannot cover resulting board with 31 dominoes
