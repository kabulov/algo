SOLUTION

questions:

insert means we have to clear position i through j in n and then insert m ?

solution & analysis & design:

lets do that straightforward:

code:

int mask = (~((1<<(j+1))-1)) | ((1<<i)-1);
int result = (n & mask) | (m << i);

mistakes & enhancements:

need testing, need maybe divide code into parts to make it easy to 
test and maintain.
