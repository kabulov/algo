SOLUTION

width - from left to right
height - from top to bottom

lets assume that array has 0 indexation
lets assume that y is counted from top of the screen
lets assume that array has length n
lets assume that x1 and x2 has 0 indexation in a row
lets assume that we dont check if y is out of range or negative (0<=(y/w)<(n/w))

then we put -1(0xFF) to full bytes from (w/8)*y+x1 to (w/8)*y+x2, (x1, x2 - numbers of pixels)  

be careful with the case where both pixels are in one byte
