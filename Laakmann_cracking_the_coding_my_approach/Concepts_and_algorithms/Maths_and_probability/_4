SOLUTION

it was not about karatsuba`s, fast fourier transform algorithms

one just had to remember that integers are a field and generator is 1

we also have to ask whether we are allowed to compare numbers (suppose we can)

so we have to implement operations:
negate()
abs()
subtract()
multiply()
divide()

divide code into parts to design and reuse, 
ask questions to clarify, 
dont make suppositions, ask
