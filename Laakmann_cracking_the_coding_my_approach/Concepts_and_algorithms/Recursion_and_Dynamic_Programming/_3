SOLUTION

it is like binary search
suppose all numbers are distinct

int find_pos(const vector<int>& v, int size) {
  int lt, rt, mid;
  lt = 0, rt = size;
  while (lt + 1 < rt) {
    mid = (lt + rt) / 2;
    if (mid < v[mid]) {
      rt = mid;
    } else {
      lt = mid;
    }
  }
  return lt; //then check outside to see if v[lt] == key
}
