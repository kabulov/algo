STATEMENT

write code to parition a linked list around a value x, 
such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.

SOLUTION

questions:

do we have operator < defined for x ?
are we doing everything in place ?
is it important to have value x in the middle of a list afterall ?

solution & analysis & design:

it is obvious that we are given a head of list, otherwise it would be not possible in some cases
to partition around value x

1.
if it is not important to have layout like : less than x, equal to x, greater than x - then
we just iterate through the list from the head and put every value smaller than x in head of the list
time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: O(1)

code:

#include <cstdlib> //NULL

template<class T>
class List {
public:
  List<T>* next;
  T data;
};
