implement a function void reverse(char* str) in c or c++ which reverses a null-terminated string 

SOLUTION  

questions:

can we use standart library functions like strlen ?
what is the content of the string?
what if it is pointing to something other than char ?
how big is it?
there are no questions as this function is so easy to program

solution & analysis:

just iterate to the middle and swap corresponding opposite elements
time complexity: O(n) , where n - size of the string
space complexity: O(1)

code:

void reverse(char* str) {
  int rt = 0;
  while(str[rt]){ //it is guaranteed to be a null terminated string so str[rt] exists
    ++rt;
  }
  --rt;
  int lt = 0;
  while(lt < rt) {
    char tmp = str[lt];
    str[lt] = str[rt];
    str[rt] = tmp;
    ++lt;
    --rt;
  }
}

mistakes & improvements:

it is a standart interview quesition, it could even be implemented recursively, but this is nightmare
everything is OK
