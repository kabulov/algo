write an algorithm such that if an element of an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0

SOLUTION

questions:

are we allowed to allocate additional memory?
are there only integer elements in the matrix ?
how big is m and n ?

solution & analysis & design:

1.
if we are allowed to use additional space 
then we allocate one array with size = max(m,n),
and assign 1,2 or 3 depending on whether i`th row,
column or row and column have to be set to zero.
or just allocate two vectors: sizes : m and n;
time complexity: O(n^2)
space complexirt: O(max(n,m))

code:

#include <vector>

using std::vector;

typedef vector<vector<int> > vvi;

void setToZero(vvi& v, int m, int n) {
  vector<int> row(m,0);
  vector<int> col(n,0);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      if (v[i][j] == 0) {
        row[i]=1;
        col[j]=1;
      }
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      if (row[i] || col[j]){
        v[i][j]=0;
      }
    }
  }
}
