STATEMENT

imagine a (literal) stack of plates. if the stack gets too high, it might topple. therefore
in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold.
implement a data structure setOfStacks that mimics this. setOfStacks should be composed of 
several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous exceeds capacity. 
setOfStacks.push() and setOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack
(that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack)
follow up:
implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on specific sub-stack.
