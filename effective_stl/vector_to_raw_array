The elements in a vector are constrained by the C++ Standard to be stored in contiguous memory, 
just like an array, so if we wish to pass v to a C API that looks something like this.

void doSomething(const int* pInts, size_t numlnts);

we can do it like this:

doSomething(&v[0], v.size()); 

Maybe. Probably. The only sticking point is if v is empty. 
If it is, v.size() is zero, and &v[0] attempts to produce a pointer to something that does not exist. 
Not good. Undefined results. A safer way to code the call is this:

if (!v.empty()) {
  doSomething(&v[0], v.size());
}
