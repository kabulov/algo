• The standard STL associative containers, set, multiset, map and multimap.

• The nonstandard sequence containers slist and rope. slist is a singly linked list, 
and rope is essentially a heavy-duty string. 

• The nonstandard associative containers hash_set, hash_multiset, hash_map, and hash_multimap. 

• vector<char> as a replacement for string. 

• vector as a replacement for the standard associative containers. 

• Several standard non-STL containers, including arrays, bitset, valarray, stack, queue, and priority_queue.
