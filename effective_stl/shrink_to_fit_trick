vector<someclass> v;
vector<someclass>(v).swap(v);

string s;
string(s).swap(s);

As an aside, 
a variant of the swap trick can be used both to clear a container 
and to reduce its capacity to the minimum your implementation offers. 
You simply do the swap with a temporary vector or string that is default-constructed:

vector<Contestant> v;
string s;
… // use v and s
vector<Contestant>().swap(v); //clear v and minimize its capacity
string().swap(s); // clear s and minimize its capacity

One final observation about the swap trick, or, rather, about swap in general. 
Swapping the contents of two containers also swaps their iterators, pointers, and references. 
Iterators, pointers, and references that used to point to elements in one container 
remain valid and point to the same elements — but in the other container— after the swap.
